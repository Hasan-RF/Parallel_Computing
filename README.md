# Parallel_Computing

This program is written on Visual Studio 2019 using C#.
It is recommended that you view the file through Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

The code file "Program.cs" can be found under \ParallelComputing\ParallelComputing\

The objective of this project is to measure the speedup we get from using threads and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel computing methods.

The output ppm files can be found under the \ParallelComputing\ParallelComputing\bin\Debug\net5.0
In case you they do not open, you can try openning them with an online PPM viewer.

Thank you
