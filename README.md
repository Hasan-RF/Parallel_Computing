# Parallel_Computing

The objective of this project is to measure the speedup we get from using threads and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel computing methods.

The code file "Program.cs" can be found under \ParallelComputing\ParallelComputing\
The output ppm files can be found under the \ParallelComputing\ParallelComputing\bin\Debug\net5.0
In case you they do not open, you can try openning them with an online PPM viewer.

This program is written on Visual Studio 2019 using C#.
It is recommended that you view the file through Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
On Visual Studio, you can use (SHIFT+CTRL+/) to quickly comment or uncomment the code and try all the approaches.

Thank you
